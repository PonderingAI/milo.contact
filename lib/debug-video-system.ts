/**
 * Potential Issues in the Video System
 *
 * 1. URL Storage Mismatch
 * ------------------------
 * In ProjectEditor (components/admin/project-editor.tsx):
 * - Video URLs are stored in the "thumbnail_url" field
 * - They're saved directly as entered by the user
 * - When using addMainVideoUrl, processing happens but still saves raw URL
 *
 * However, in project-data.ts:
 * - extractVideoInfo expects specific URL formats
 * - If a URL isn't in the expected format, it might return null
 *
 * 2. Video Platform/ID Not Saved
 * ------------------------------
 * While the raw URL is saved as thumbnail_url, the video_platform and video_id
 * fields might not be getting properly populated during project creation/update.
 *
 * In the API routes:
 * - projects/create/route.ts and projects/update/[id]/route.ts
 * - These should handle saving the video_platform and video_id fields
 * - But they might only save the raw URL in thumbnail_url
 *
 * 3. Latest Project Handling
 * --------------------------
 * In HeroSection (components/hero-section.tsx):
 * - When hero_bg_type is "latest_project", it tries to use latestProject.video_url
 * - But Project type might have thumbnail_url, not video_url
 * - Or it might be checking video_url when the URL is in thumbnail_url
 *
 * 4. Extraction Function Issues
 * ----------------------------
 * In extractVideoInfo (lib/project-data.ts):
 * - Might not handle all variations of YouTube/Vimeo URLs
 * - Error handling might cause it to return null for valid URLs
 *
 * 5. VideoBackground Component
 * ---------------------------
 * In VideoBackground (components/video-background.tsx):
 * - Might have issues with error handling
 * - Could be showing fallback image too eagerly
 *
 * How to Diagnose:
 * 1. Add console.logs in project-editor.tsx to see what's being saved
 * 2. Add console.logs in project-data.ts to see URL extraction
 * 3. Add console.logs in hero-section.tsx to see what URLs are being used
 * 4. Check database to see what's actually stored in the fields
 */

/**
 * Correct Data Flow Should Be:
 *
 * 1. User enters YouTube/Vimeo URL in project editor
 * 2. URL is processed by extractVideoInfo to get platform and ID
 * 3. URL is saved in thumbnail_url
 * 4. Platform is saved in video_platform
 * 5. ID is saved in video_id
 * 6. When user selects "Latest Project Video" in site settings
 * 7. HeroSection loads and sees hero_bg_type="latest_project"
 * 8. It gets the latestProject and checks thumbnail_url (or video_url?)
 * 9. It extracts platform and ID from the URL
 * 10. VideoBackground receives platform, ID, and fallback image
 * 11. VideoBackground creates the correct embed URL and displays video
