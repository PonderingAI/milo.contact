# Security Management

This document outlines the security features and practices implemented in the portfolio application.

## Dependency Management

The application includes a comprehensive dependency management system that helps maintain security by:

1. **Tracking Dependencies**: Automatically scans and tracks all project dependencies
2. **Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies security vulnerabilities in dependencies
3. **Automatic Updates**: Configurable update policies to keep dependencies secure

### Security Dashboard

The Security Dashboard provides a visual interface for monitoring and managing the security of your application's dependencies. Key features include:

- **Security Score**: Overall security rating based on vulnerabilities and outdated packages
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies and displays known security issues
- **Dependabot Integration**: Shows and prioritizes GitHub Dependabot alerts
- **Update Management**: Configure global and per-package update policies
- **Masonry Layout**: Widgets automatically arrange to fill available space efficiently
- **Persistent Layout**: Dashboard layout and settings are saved between sessions

### Update Policies

The system supports three update modes:

1. **Off**: No automatic updates will be applied
2. **Security Only**: Only security-related updates will be applied
3. **All Updates**: All available updates will be applied

**Important**: Packages with Dependabot alerts will be updated automatically regardless of update mode settings to protect your application from security vulnerabilities.

### Security Audit

The Security Audit feature scans your dependencies for known security vulnerabilities and provides:

1. A comprehensive security score
2. Detailed information about each vulnerability
3. Recommendations for improving security

## Implementation Details

The security system is implemented using:

- **API Routes**: Server-side API routes for scanning and updating dependencies
- **React Components**: Client-side components for visualizing security information
- **Local Storage**: Persists dashboard layout and settings between sessions
- **Masonry Layout**: Efficiently organizes widgets to fill available space

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Scans**: Run security scans regularly to identify new vulnerabilities
2. **Prompt Updates**: Apply security updates promptly to minimize exposure
3. **Review Dependencies**: Regularly review and audit dependencies to remove unused or risky packages
4. **Monitor Alerts**: Pay special attention to Dependabot alerts as they indicate high-priority security issues

## Future Enhancements

Planned security enhancements include:

1. Integration with additional vulnerability databases
2. Automated security scanning on deployment
3. Enhanced notification system for critical vulnerabilities
4. Dependency license compliance monitoring
