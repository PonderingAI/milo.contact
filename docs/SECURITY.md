# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please send an email to security@example.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## Security Features

### Dependency Management

The application includes a comprehensive security center that helps you manage dependencies and security vulnerabilities:

- **Automatic Vulnerability Detection**: The system automatically scans dependencies for known security vulnerabilities using npm audit data.
- **Security Score**: A calculated score based on the number and severity of vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
- **Update Modes**: Configure how dependencies are updated:
  - **Off**: No automatic updates
  - **Security Only**: Only security-related updates are applied
  - **All Updates**: All updates are applied
  - **Global**: Follow the global setting

### Update Policies

You can set update policies at both the global and individual dependency level:

1. **Global Policy**: Sets the default behavior for all dependencies
2. **Individual Policies**: Override the global policy for specific dependencies

### Security Audit

Run security audits to check for new vulnerabilities in your dependencies. The system will:

1. Scan all dependencies for known vulnerabilities
2. Update the security score
3. Provide recommendations for fixing security issues

### Integration with Dependabot

The system works alongside GitHub's Dependabot:

1. **Complementary Functionality**: While Dependabot creates pull requests for updates, our system provides a dashboard view and fine-grained control over update policies.
2. **Security Focus**: Both systems prioritize security updates, ensuring your application remains secure.
3. **Local Management**: Our system allows you to manage dependencies directly from the admin dashboard, without requiring GitHub integration.

### Automatic Detection of Dependencies

The system automatically detects all dependencies in your project by:

1. Reading the `package.json` file
2. Using `npm ls` to get the actual installed versions
3. Using `npm outdated` to check for available updates
4. Using `npm audit` to check for security vulnerabilities

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Audits**: Run security audits regularly to check for new vulnerabilities
2. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Update dependencies regularly, especially those with security vulnerabilities
3. **Use Security-Only Updates**: For production environments, consider using the "Security Only" update mode
4. **Review Changes**: Always review changes before applying updates to ensure compatibility

## Implementation Details

The security center uses the following data sources:

1. **npm audit**: For vulnerability information
2. **npm ls**: For installed dependency information
3. **npm outdated**: For latest version information
4. **package.json**: For required dependency information

Vulnerability severity levels:
- **Critical**: Requires immediate attention
- **High**: Should be addressed as soon as possible
- **Medium**: Should be addressed in the next update cycle
- **Low**: Should be addressed when convenient

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the security center:

1. **Dependency Tab Not Loading**: Try refreshing the page or check your network connection
2. **WebSocket Errors**: These are typically related to browser extensions or network issues and don't affect the functionality of the security center
3. **Update Settings Not Responding**: Try resetting all settings using the "Reset All Settings" button
4. **Database Tables Missing**: Use the "Show Setup SQL" button to create the necessary database tables
