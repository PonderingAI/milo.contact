# Security Documentation

## Overview

The Milo Presedo portfolio includes a comprehensive security system that automatically monitors and manages dependencies, detects vulnerabilities, and provides tools for maintaining the security of your application.

## Features

### Automatic Dependency Monitoring

The system automatically:

- Tracks all project dependencies from package.json
- Checks for outdated packages using `npm outdated`
- Scans for security vulnerabilities using `npm audit`
- Calculates a security score based on the state of your dependencies

### Security Dashboard

The security dashboard provides:

- A real-time overview of your application's security status
- Vulnerability counts and details
- Outdated package information
- Configurable update policies

### Automatic Updates

The system can automatically update dependencies based on your preferences:

- **Security Only**: Only update packages with security vulnerabilities
- **All Updates**: Keep all packages up to date
- **Manual**: No automatic updates

### Database Integration

The system stores dependency information in your Supabase database:

- Dependency versions and status
- Update history
- Security audit results

## Setup

The security system is designed to work automatically without manual setup. When you access the security dashboard for the first time, the system will:

1. Check if the required database tables exist
2. Create the tables if they don't exist
3. Populate the tables with your project's dependencies
4. Run an initial security scan

## Maintenance

The system performs regular maintenance tasks:

- Hourly checks for security updates
- Daily synchronization with package.json
- Weekly full security audits

## Best Practices

To maintain optimal security:

1. Review the security dashboard regularly
2. Set appropriate update policies for critical dependencies
3. Lock versions of dependencies that require testing before updates
4. Run security audits after adding new dependencies

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the security system:

1. Check the console for error messages
2. Verify that your Supabase connection is working
3. Ensure your environment has permission to run npm commands
4. Try refreshing the dependencies by clicking the "Refresh" button

## Integration with Other Tools

The security system works alongside:

1. **GitHub's Dependabot**: Complementary functionality for dependency updates
2. **npm**: Uses npm commands for accurate dependency information
3. **Supabase**: Stores dependency settings and update history
