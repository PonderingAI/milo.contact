# Revert Notes - Media Upload Functionality

## Issue Summary
The media upload functionality in the project creation/editing page was changed, resulting in:
1. New media no longer showing image previews
2. The old bottom bar interface returning
3. Possible other UI/UX regressions in the media management interface

## Files Reverted
The following files were reverted to restore proper media upload functionality:

1. `components/admin/project-media-uploader.tsx`
2. `components/admin/project-editor.tsx`
3. `components/admin/unified-media-library.tsx`
4. `components/admin/project-form.tsx` (if applicable)
5. `app/api/bulk-upload/route.ts` (if applicable)
6. `app/api/process-video-url/route.ts` (if applicable)

## Post-Revert Tasks
After reverting to the working version, the following tasks should be completed:

1. **Test Media Upload Functionality**
   - Create a new project and upload media
   - Verify image previews appear correctly
   - Verify the modern interface is present (not the old bottom bar)
   - Test video URL processing

2. **Verify Other Project Management Features**
   - Test project creation end-to-end
   - Test project editing
   - Test project deletion
   - Verify BTS image management still works

3. **Document Current State**
   - Update documentation to reflect the current state of the media upload system
   - Note any features that were in development but lost in the revert

4. **Plan Forward Development**
   - Identify any features from the reverted code that should be reimplemented
   - Create a development plan for improving the media upload system

## Known Issues to Address
- The media preview functionality needs to be maintained in future updates
- The modern interface should be preserved in any future refactoring
- Any performance improvements from recent changes should be reimplemented if lost in the revert

## Development Continuation
To continue development after this revert:

1. Create a new branch from the reverted state
2. Implement changes incrementally with thorough testing
3. Focus on maintaining the working media preview functionality
4. Document all changes to the media upload system
