# Development Continuation Plan

## Current Status
After reverting the problematic changes to the media upload system, we have restored the working functionality including:
- Image previews for uploaded media
- Modern interface (not the old bottom bar)
- Proper integration with the project editor

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Stabilize the Current System**
   - Add comprehensive tests for the media upload functionality
   - Document the current implementation thoroughly
   - Fix any minor issues that existed before the problematic changes

2. **Implement Authentication Improvements**
   - Continue work on the Clerk integration
   - Finalize the admin role management system
   - Complete the user authentication flow

3. **Database Management**
   - Ensure all necessary tables are created and properly structured
   - Complete the database seeding functionality
   - Implement proper error handling for database operations

## Medium-Term Goals

1. **Media System Enhancements**
   - Implement media categorization
   - Add batch operations for media files
   - Improve search and filtering capabilities

2. **Project Management**
   - Enhance the project editing interface
   - Implement project versioning
   - Add project templates

3. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Complete the analytics widgets
   - Implement user activity monitoring
   - Add system health monitoring

## Long-Term Vision

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement lazy loading for media
   - Optimize database queries
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data

2. **Feature Expansion**
   - Add support for more media types
   - Implement collaborative editing
   - Add scheduling and publishing workflows

3. **Integration Capabilities**
   - Add API endpoints for external integration
   - Implement webhooks for events
   - Create export/import functionality

## Development Approach

1. **Incremental Changes**
   - Make small, testable changes
   - Avoid large refactoring without thorough testing
   - Document all changes

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Implement unit tests for critical components
   - Add integration tests for key workflows
   - Perform manual testing for UI components

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep documentation updated with changes
   - Document APIs and component interfaces
   - Create user guides for complex features
