# Upload Component Analysis

## Current Implementation vs. Desired Implementation

### Current Implementation in ProjectMediaUploader

The `ProjectMediaUploader` component currently uses a tabbed interface from shadcn/ui:

\`\`\`jsx
<Tabs defaultValue="upload">
  <TabsList className="bg-gray-800">
    <TabsTrigger value="upload">Upload</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="library">Media Library</TabsTrigger>
    {mediaType !== "image" && <TabsTrigger value="video">Video URL</TabsTrigger>}
  </TabsList>

  <TabsContent value="upload">
    {/* Drag & drop upload area */}
  </TabsContent>

  <TabsContent value="library">
    {/* Media library button */}
  </TabsContent>

  <TabsContent value="video">
    {/* Video URL input */}
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>
\`\`\`

This creates a windowed interface where only one section is visible at a time, controlled by the tabs.

### Desired Implementation

The desired implementation is a single component with all elements visible at once:

\`\`\`jsx
<div className="space-y-4">
  {/* Media Library button at the top */}
  <button onClick={openMediaBrowser} className="w-full py-3 rounded-lg bg-[#0f1520]">
    Browse Media Library
  </button>

  {/* Video URL input in the middle */}
  <div className="relative">
    <input
      type="text"
      value={url}
      onChange={handleUrlChange}
      placeholder={urlPlaceholder}
      className="w-full py-3 px-3 pr-10 rounded-lg bg-[#0f1520]"
    />
    <button onClick={handleUrlSubmit} className="absolute right-2 top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2">
      <ArrowRight size={22} />
    </button>
  </div>

  {/* Browse Device button at the bottom */}
  <button onClick={triggerFileInput} className="w-full py-3 rounded-lg bg-[#0f1520]">
    Browse Device
  </button>
</div>
\`\`\`

This would show all three elements at once, stacked vertically.

## Why the Change Didn't Work

### Component Hierarchy Issue

The main issue is that we have two separate components that handle uploads:

1. `UploadWidget` - The base component that was updated to show all elements at once
2. `ProjectMediaUploader` - A wrapper component used in the project creation page that implements its own tabbed interface

The changes were made to `UploadWidget`, but `ProjectMediaUploader` doesn't use `UploadWidget` - it implements its own UI with tabs.

### Implementation Mismatch

Looking at the code:

1. `components/admin/upload-widget.tsx` was updated to show all elements at once
2. `components/admin/project-media-uploader.tsx` still uses a tabbed interface

The project creation page uses `ProjectMediaUploader`, not `UploadWidget` directly, so the changes to `UploadWidget` don't affect the project creation page.

## Solution

To fix this, we need to either:

1. Update `ProjectMediaUploader` to use the same layout as `UploadWidget`
2. Update `ProjectMediaUploader` to use `UploadWidget` instead of implementing its own UI
3. Replace all instances of `ProjectMediaUploader` with `UploadWidget`

The simplest approach would be to modify `ProjectMediaUploader` to remove the tabs and show all elements at once, similar to the updated `UploadWidget`.

## Implementation Plan

1. Remove the `Tabs` component from `ProjectMediaUploader`
2. Implement a layout similar to `UploadWidget` with all elements visible at once
3. Keep the same functionality but change the presentation
4. Ensure the drag & drop behavior still works correctly

This should result in a consistent UI across all upload components in the application.
