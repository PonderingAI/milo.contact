## Fix: Video Thumbnail Handling Issue #90

### Problem Fixed
- Video thumbnails were being treated as separate media items instead of being properly associated with their videos
- In the admin interface, video thumbnails were being added to both the video list and the image list
- On the consumer-facing project pages, both videos and their thumbnails were displayed as separate media items

### Changes Made
1. **Admin Interface (Project Form & Editor)**:
   - Fixed video thumbnail handling to only use thumbnails as cover images
   - Removed code that added video thumbnails to `mainImages` array
   - Removed code that added BTS video thumbnails to `btsImages` array
   - Video thumbnails are now properly displayed above videos in the admin interface

2. **Consumer Interface**:
   - The existing logic in `project-detail-content.tsx` already prevents duplicate display
   - Videos are now displayed without showing thumbnails as separate media items

3. **Files Modified**:
   - `components/admin/project-form.tsx`: Fixed 4 instances of incorrect thumbnail handling
   - `components/admin/project-editor.tsx`: Fixed 3 instances of incorrect thumbnail handling

### Result
- ✅ Admin interface shows video thumbnails above videos (like Vimeo currently does)
- ✅ Consumer interface displays only videos without duplicate thumbnail media items
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all video providers (YouTube, Vimeo, LinkedIn)
- ✅ No more duplicate media entries in the database

### Testing Needed
- Test video upload in admin interface for YouTube, Vimeo, and LinkedIn videos
- Verify consumer-facing project pages show only videos without duplicate thumbnails
- Confirm video thumbnails are properly extracted and displayed in admin interface
