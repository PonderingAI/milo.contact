# Security Policy

## Dependency Vulnerability Management

This project uses an automated security monitoring system to track and manage dependencies with known vulnerabilities. The security center provides real-time information about the security status of all dependencies.

### Data Sources

The security center sources vulnerability data from multiple authoritative sources:

1. **GitHub Dependabot Alerts** - Direct integration with GitHub's Dependabot API to retrieve security advisories
2. **npm audit** - Regular automated scans using npm's built-in security audit
3. **Snyk Vulnerability Database** - Cross-reference with Snyk's comprehensive vulnerability database
4. **NIST National Vulnerability Database** - Verification against the NVD for comprehensive coverage

### Automatic Dependency Detection

The security center automatically:
- Scans your project's package.json file to detect all dependencies
- Monitors for newly added dependencies when package.json changes
- Tracks transitive dependencies (dependencies of your dependencies)
- Detects development dependencies separately from production dependencies

### Update Modes

Each dependency can be configured with one of four update modes:

1. **Global** - Follows the global update policy (default)
2. **Off** - No automatic updates for this dependency
3. **Conservative** - Only security patches are applied automatically
4. **Aggressive** - All updates (including features) are applied automatically

### Security Score Calculation

The security score is calculated based on:
- Number and severity of vulnerabilities
- Age of dependencies
- Update frequency
- Security patch response time
- Overall dependency health

### Vulnerability Severity Levels

Vulnerabilities are categorized by severity:
- **Critical** (CVSS 9.0-10.0): Requires immediate attention
- **High** (CVSS 7.0-8.9): Should be addressed as soon as possible
- **Medium** (CVSS 4.0-6.9): Should be scheduled for remediation
- **Low** (CVSS 0.1-3.9): Should be addressed as resources permit

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please send an email to security@example.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

Please include the following information in your report:
- Type of vulnerability
- Path to the vulnerable code
- Proof of concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed. The update process is:

1. Vulnerability is reported or detected
2. Security team verifies and assesses the vulnerability
3. A fix is developed and tested
4. Security update is released
5. Users are notified through the security center

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices. If you report a vulnerability:
- We will confirm receipt of your vulnerability report within 24 hours
- We will provide an estimated timeline for a fix
- We will notify you when the vulnerability is fixed
- We will credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

Now, let's update the security center to use more accurate data sources and automatically detect new dependencies:
